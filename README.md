Scripts for analysing microbiome diversity, composition changeing and network
These scripts will analysing next-generation sequence data (Miseq) of 52 rhizosphere microbiome which were inoculated with 1, 2, 4 and 8 species 
bacterial consortia. Then we will disentangle the mechanism underlying the beneficial impacts of diverse bacterial comsortium inoculation on 
rhizopshere microbiome and plant performance.
